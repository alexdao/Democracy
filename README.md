==========

Android app to make available the political activities in the United States, including the 2016 election, the Senate, the House, bills, candidates, votes, etc. 

We hope to make the U.S. government and politics more transparent, and therefore, accountable, for all. Our website can be found at http://lumivote.appspot.com/
